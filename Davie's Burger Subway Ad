1. Start by getting a feel for the orders table:

 SELECT *
 FROM orders
 LIMIT 10;

2. HOW RECENT IS THE DATA

SELECT order_date
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

3. Write a query that selects only the special_instructions column

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
LIMIT 20;

4. CAN YOU EDIT THE QUERY SO THAT WE ARE THE ONLY RETURNING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS?

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions is NOT NULL;

5. LETS GO EVEN FURTHER AND SORT THE INSTRUCTIONS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions is NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC
LIMIT 20;

6. LETS SEARCH FOR SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT HAVE THE WORD 'sauce'

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%sauce%';

7. LETS SEARCH FOR SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT HAVE THE WORD 'DOOR'.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%door%';

8. LETS SEARCH FOR SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT HAVE THE WORD 'BOX'

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';

9. instead of returning the special instructions, also return their order id's

SELECT id AS '#', 
   special_instructions AS 'Notes'
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';
